SI-SIGN Verification Tool
=========================

The purpose of this tool is to enable metadata verification of the reports produced by [SI-SIGN software](https://si-sign.pl/) against the data saved on the Waves blockchain.

You can either upload a report containing such metadata or fill in event details by hand.

The official instance of this tool can be found [here](https://www.verify.si-sign.pl/).
